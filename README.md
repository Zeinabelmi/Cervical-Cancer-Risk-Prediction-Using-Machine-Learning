    <h1>Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction Using XG-Boost Classifier</h1>

    <p>This project involves building and training an XG-Boost classifier to predict whether a person has a risk of developing cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a serious condition that causes thousands of deaths each year, highlighting the importance of early detection and prevention.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Task #1: Understand the Problem Statement and Business Case</li>
        <li>Task #2: Import Libraries and Datasets</li>
        <li>Task #3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
        <li>Task #4: Conduct Data Visualization</li>
        <li>Task #5: Prepare the Data for Model Training</li>
        <li>Task #6: Understand the Theory and Intuition Behind XG-Boost</li>
        <li>Task #7: Train and Evaluate the XG-Boost Algorithm</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains information from 858 patients, including features such as the number of pregnancies, smoking habits, STD history, demographics, and medical records.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By utilizing the XG-Boost algorithm, we aim to create a predictive model that can effectively identify individuals at risk of developing cervical cancer, ultimately aiding in early intervention and treatment.</p>
