<h1>Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction Using XG-Boost Classifier</h1>
<p>This project involves building and training an XG-Boost classifier to predict whether a person has a risk of developing cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a serious condition that causes thousands of deaths each year, highlighting the importance of early detection and prevention.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
    Task #1: Understand the Problem Statement and Business Case
    Task #2: Import Libraries and Datasets
    Task #3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
    Task #4: Perform Data Visualization
    Task #5: Prepare the data before Model Training
    Task #6: Understand the Theory and Intuition Behind XG-Boost
    Task #7: Train and Evaluate XG-Boost Algorithm

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The dataset contains information from 858 patients, including features such as number of pregnancies, smoking habits, STD history, demographics, and medical records.</p> 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By utilizing XG-Boost algorithm, we aim to create a predictive model that can effectively identify individuals at risk of developing cervical cancer, ultimately aiding in early intervention and treatment.</p>
